# FS API Sample App

A sample app for getting started with the [FamilySearch API](https://familysearch.org/developers/).
The app uses the [fs-js-lite SDK](https://github.com/FamilySearch/fs-js-lite)
to show how to perform basic API operations such as authentication, 
loading the user's profile, and loading the user's pedigree.

_This app is not intended to be an example of best practices for the web._
